# Building-performance-analysis
Building performance analysis description

## Overview
This project is an intelligent building performance optimization system that integrates *Artificial Intelligence (AI), **Internet of Things (IoT), **Natural Language Processing (NLP), and **Blockchain* to enhance energy efficiency, improve occupant comfort, and secure operational data in smart buildings.

The system collects real-time environmental and structural data using IoT sensors, processes it through an AI model to predict and optimize performance, and interacts with users via a chatbot interface. All sensitive data is secured using blockchain-based encryption methods.

## Features

- *AI-Based Energy and Condition Prediction*
  - Trained models forecast energy consumption based on occupancy and environmental data.
  - Real-time anomaly detection and maintenance alerts.

- *Chatbot Interface*
  - Natural language interface for building occupants and facility managers.
  - Allows users to query building status and receive intelligent suggestions.

- *IoT Device Integration*
  - Real-time data collection from sensors (temperature, humidity, CO₂, noise, vibration).
  - Seamless streaming and processing for performance optimization.

- *Blockchain-Backed Data Security*
  - Decentralized logging of sensor and system data.
  - Ensures privacy, integrity, and role-based access control.

## Technologies Used

- *Python 3.9+*
- *Flask* – For chatbot API interface
- *Scikit-learn / TensorFlow* – AI model development
- *MQTT / HTTP APIs* – IoT sensor data communication
- *Matplotlib / Plotly* – Data visualization
- *Blockchain (Simulated Ledger)* – Data integrity and security
